For this program:
Four diffrent types of data are provided: 1. A CourseInfo, 2. AssignmentGroup 3.  AssignmentInfo, and 4. LearnerSubmission objects. And all are added to index.js.
I will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification.
