# SBA308
For this program:
Four diffrent types of data are provided: 1. A CourseInfo, 2. AssignmentGroup 3.  AssignmentInfo, and 4. LearnerSubmission objects. And all are added to index.js.
I will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described in the assignment.
In the js file I added the data sample first.
Then 

// Main function to process learner data
function getLearnerData(courseInfo, assignmentGroup, learnerSubmissions)

// Process each learner's submissions with for loop

// Apply late submission penalty

// Calculate averages and format result

// Helper function to find a learner's data in the result array

// Helper function to find an assignment in the assignments array
